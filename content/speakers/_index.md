### Factors influencing low adoption rate of technologies in developing countries

*Abstract*: Technologies such as machine learning, cloud computing, and IoT seem to be the most attractive solution to a myriad of problems basseting developing countries, but there is a general low adoption rate of these technologies in developing countries in general, and South African Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), consumers and government institutions especially in rural areas. There is a need to investigate the significant factors hindering the adoption of these technologies. We have adopted various theories such Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI) and sometimes combine these theories with other Information Systems theories as a theoretical lens to shed light on the reasons for low adoption rates. Good use of theory aids in designing the study more effectively, as well as being useful to take a broad view of the end results. Both qualitative and quantitate methods have been employed to increase the understanding of this phenomenon. Quantitative data was collected through questionnaires and analyzed using regression analysis or structural equation modeling and machine learning algorithms.  Qualitative data is collected through interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings from these studies indicate that some of the reasons for low adoption rates are awareness. Some respondents argue that they will adopt the technologies if it will reduce the organization’s IT expenditure. Some find the complexity and cost of these technologies were the most significant factors determining their potential for adoption. In this paper, we will look at the case studies of the adoption of cloud computing, Internet banking, and School management system.

### Emerging trends and new research directions in volunteer management

*Abstract*: Nonprofit organizations often face challenges related to meeting time-dependent, and sometimes time-critical, operational needs with a workforce composed of volunteers or a mix of volunteers and paid staff.  The operations research literature has explored many important aspects of nonprofit operations, and now emerging trends in online platforms have led to new opportunities in workforce management for nonprofits.  This talk will consider how the nonprofit sector is embracing online platforms, particularly in the area of volunteer management.  The talk will review recent research in the area, highlighting commonalities with commercial applications and unique challenges in volunteer management.

### Emerging trends and new research directions in volunteer management

*Abstract*: Nonprofit organizations often face challenges related to meeting time-dependent, and sometimes time-critical, operational needs with a workforce composed of volunteers or a mix of volunteers and paid staff.  The operations research literature has explored many important aspects of nonprofit operations, and now emerging trends in online platforms have led to new opportunities in workforce management for nonprofits.  This talk will consider how the nonprofit sector is embracing online platforms, particularly in the area of volunteer management.  The talk will review recent research in the area, highlighting commonalities with commercial applications and unique challenges in volunteer management.

The registration fees for *in-person* participation are the following:

|  | Early (until September 20) | Regular (until October 4) | Late (after October 4) |
| ----------- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ACM member          | $500 | $700 | $900 |

*Refund policy: tickets refundable up to September 23 (minus a $50 fee).*

**EAAMO'22 is committed to having an in-person conference**. Keynote talks, paper presentations, posters, doctoral consortium, faculty network sessions as well as other social events are organized in person. However, we would like to make the academic part of the conference (keynote talks and paper presentations) accessible to a wider audience for listening, not for participation. Therefore, EAAMO'22 will have virtual access through the [Hopin](https://hopin.com/) platform. Events like a doctoral consortium, faculty network sessions, and part of social events are *in-person only*. The virtual part of the conference will have separate social events like discussion tables, and speed networking. The full schedule for both in-person and virtual will be available on the [schedule web page](https://eaamo.org/schedule/).

The registration fees for *virtual* participation are the following:

|  | Early (until September 20) | Regular (after September 20) |
| ----------- | :---: | :---: |
| ACM member          | $25 | $30 |
| Non-ACM/SIG member  | $50 | $55 |
| Student             | $10 | $15 |

**Important note**: Participants who received a complimentary registration grant will receive a code that will allow registration for free. **Please wait for that code before registering!** We will not be able to reimburse registration if one registers without this code.

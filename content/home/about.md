EAAMO '23 is organized by the [Mechanism Design for Social Good](https://www.md4sg.com) (MD4SG) initiative, and builds on the MD4SG technical [workshop series](https://www.md4sg.com/workshop/index.html) and tutorials at conferences including ACM EC, ACM COMPASS, ACM FAccT and WINE. The conference will feature keynote talks, panels, and contributed presentations across numerous fields. In line with the MD4SG core values of bridging research and practice, the conference will bring together researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners in various government and non-government organizations, community organizations, and industry to build multi-disciplinary pipelines.

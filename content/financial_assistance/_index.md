At EAAMO'23, we strive to create an inclusive and accessible conference where everyone has an opportunity to participate and contribute. We firmly believe that diversity enriches our conference, and we are eager to collaborate with participants to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all. As part of our commitment to promoting diversity and removing barriers to attendance, we are delighted to offer financial assistance to individuals in need.

Our financial assistance program includes two options: a **registration fee waiver** and/or a **travel grant**. The registration fee waiver eliminates the cost of attending the conference, allowing individuals to participate at EAAMO'23. The travel grant provides additional support to cover travel and accommodation costs associated with attending EAAMO'23.

To handle the financial support process efficiently, we have dedicated travel grant chairs who will promptly respond to inquiries and provide assistance. They are committed to addressing any questions or concerns regarding the financial support application process.

As we anticipate a high demand for travel grants, we kindly request that individuals apply for funding only if they do not have alternative resources to support their participation. If possible, we encourage applicants to seek funding from their own institutions or alternative sources. Additionally, we ask that applicants consider the minimum amount necessary to attend the conference, taking into account travel and accommodation costs. This approach ensures that we can fulfill the needs and support as many individuals as possible.

The application will be available up to <span style="color:red">**August 10, 2023**</span>.
We aim to release financial support packages by the **end of August**.

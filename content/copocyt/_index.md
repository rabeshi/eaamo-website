# Learning from Indigenous Voices in Mexico

One of the most ambitious diversity programs that we undertook at EAAMO ’22 was the sponsorship of a cohort of 8 female indigenous students from the Huasteca region of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Their participation in the conference was the culmination of the “MD4SG-COPOCYT Summer of Science”, a collaboration between MD4SG and the Science and Technology Council of San Luis Potosí ([COPOCYT](https://slp.gob.mx/copocyt/Paginas/Inicio.aspx)). The Summer of Science is a new program in which indigenous students prepare research proposals aimed at using STEM to improve their local communities. Researchers from the MD4SG community are paired with students on the basis of how their research interests match with student proposals, and over the summer, they meet virtually to work towards preparing an academic poster. These posters are subsequently presented at EAAMO to the wider academic community participating in the conference.

This year’s students were selected with projects under the themes of: preservation of indigenous language/culture, affordable housing, and equitable access to healthcare for indigenous communities. We invite you to read more about their backgrounds and projects below!

**Acknowledgements**: We are deeply indebted to our EAAMO sponsors, the McArthur Foundation, the Sloan foundation, and PIT-UN, for providing funds which paved the way for sponsoring these students registration fees. In addition, we would also like to thank the government of San Luis Potosi for providing travel funds for our students, as well as the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey and the National Association of Universities and Higher Education Institutions of Mexico (ANUIES) for greatly facilitating and sponsoring our students’ visa process.

- Can you tell us more about your community? (Name, language, geography, some traditions, etc.)
> My community is called Xolol and it belongs to the municipality of San Antonio, S.L.P. The language spoken is Tének. My community has a strong relationship to the Catholic religion and we have many distinct customs. Some of the main traditions include: the patronal festival which takes place every year, the main celebration for our dearly departed, and the entrance and exit of local authorities, which is realized as a ritual, amongst many others.

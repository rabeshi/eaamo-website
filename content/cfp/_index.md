The second **Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization** (EAAMO ‘22) Call for Partifipation will be announced soon.

<!--The second **Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization** (EAAMO ‘22) will take place in October 2022, in Washington DC, USA.
 
The goal of this event is to highlight work where techniques from algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from the social sciences and humanistic studies, can improve access to opportunity for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities. 
 
We solicit submissions in the **research track** and **policy and practice track**. Submissions can include research, survey, and position papers as well as problem- and practice-driven submissions by academics from any discipline and practitioners from any sector. For more details on submitting to each track, please visit each track's page: 

 - *(English)* Call for participation:
  - [Research Track](https://eaamo.org/cfpresearch/) 
  - [Policy & Practice Track](https://eaamo.org/cfppolicyandpractice/)

 We encourage submissions from across various disciplines and covering domains including civic participation, data economies, discrimination and bias, economic inequality, economic development, education, environment and climate, healthcare, housing, labor markets, and law and policy. Papers will be peer-reviewed by experts in the disciplinary area. The deadline for submissions is <span style="color:red">**March 2022**.</span> -->
